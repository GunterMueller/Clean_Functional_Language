Dependencies

The most global dependencies have been enumareted here. Look at
datatype definitions for more local dependencies.

e.g. T_ypeObjectType and T_ypeID in StdDynamic.{icl,dcl}
Objects of these type are used in both the compiler and the 
conversion-routines. These dependencies cannot be automatically
checked and are listed there.

More global dependencies:
- :: _<module_name>_Module = __Module;

  The name of constructor must be '__Module'. The graph_to_string
  routine uses this for fast identification of types.
