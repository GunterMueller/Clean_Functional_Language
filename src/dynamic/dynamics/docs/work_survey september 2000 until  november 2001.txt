September 2000 - november 2001
------------------------------

- General
  * bug fixes compiler, {static,dynamic}-linker, conversion functions and
    StdEnv 2.0
  * optimalizations
  * internal dynamics distributions

- Static linker
  * added user defined sections
  * import libraries

- Dynamic linker
  * detected and corrected the jump problem

- Code generator
  * direct references to the start of a constructor section replaced by
    indirect references over the constructor label

- Dynamics
  * type dependent functions
  * dumpDynamic-tool
  * discussions about dynamics (Rinus, John, Artem, Marco)
  * design & implementation of strongly typed dynamics
  * initial support for version management of conversion functions
  * design data dynamics (dynamics at almost no cost)
  * design & implementation nested aka lazy dynamics
  * design overloaded & polymorphic dynamics
 
- Marco Pil's thesis
  * reading and correcting (mainly chapter 4)
  * discussions

- structure Clean 2.0-distributions

Current work
------------
- implementation of lazy dynamics in order to create an internal
  distribution.


Future work
-----------
- finish lazy dynamics
- cvs-synchronization
- testing, bug-fixes & stablisation
- internal release
- design & implementation unique dynamics
- version management for both dynamics and libraries (md5)
- Marco's thesis
- design & implementation of copied dynamics
- conversion of objects using dynamics (together with Artem)
- everything I forgot...
- external release of dynamics

Current status
--------------
The dynamic apply can be performed. The result which may contain lazy
dynamics can be written to disk. I am working on reading lazy dynamics
from disk.
