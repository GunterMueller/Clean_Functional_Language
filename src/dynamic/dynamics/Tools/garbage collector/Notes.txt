Final notes for the garbage collector:

modules: dynGarbCollector (main)			own
         DynamicRefTools (used by Zoltan also)		own
         fileSystem					own
	 CopyFile					Zoltan's

	DynamicRefTools is newer than the one you can get from Zoltan,
	  but it should work fine for his program also. 
	  (I've only deleted unnecessary comments, and cleaned up the mess.)
	
	fileSystem is not used by Zoltan. (as I know)
	
	CopyFile is Zoltan's, if you get a newer one from him, the Garb. collector
	  should work fine with that also.

other important notes:

1.the (==) of paths is necessary to be good. At the moment the module fileSystem
  exports it, but the difference of long and short paths are not handled.
  Anyway: it didn't cause problems so far.
  BUT it is important: necessary files can be deleted if we don't recognise
  that two directories are the same.

2.the garbage collector needs a file called "rootDir.txt" in the directory
  given back by GetDynamicLinkerPath. The program handels (only) one root
  directory.

3.It produces log messages after a collection by APPENDING lines to the file
  dynGarbCollectorLog.txt in the same directory.
