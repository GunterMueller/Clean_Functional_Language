TO DO LIST FOR DYNAMIC LINKER

- If a dynamic cannot be found, then the dynamic linker reports
  an error and aborts. The client application terminates with 
  an access violation error. (StdDynamicError)
- an object-file with the .o suffix must be generated by the
  codegenerator. *.obj are considered object files for other
  languages.
