Static linker bug list:

(pc):
- relocation section is not correctly generated.
- during a 'normal' link i.e. eager nor lazy library symbol disappear from the list of
  imported symbols. The new linker uses the old linker's datastructures and functions
  which remove redundant symbols. In the new situation, this behaviour is not desirable
  in the case of complement generation.
  
(mac):
- overflow of TOC not detected
