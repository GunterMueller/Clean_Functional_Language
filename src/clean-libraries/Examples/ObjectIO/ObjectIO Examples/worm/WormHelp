The worm is directed by the arrow-keys. Portions of food (little
magenta rectangles) will appear randomly in the playfield (one
at a time). When the worm hits food it will eat it, after which
the worm grows. Every portion of food gives you a certain
amount of points.

The higher the speed of the worm, the more points you score per
portion. The game is over when the worm hits itself, one of the
obstacles, or the boundaries of the playfield.

Every time you score 500 points (i.e. at 500,1000,1500 etc.) you
will enter a new level. The levels all have different obstacles to
make the life of the worm a bit more complicated.
